# 08_LPSPI

## Description
A simple LPSPI transfer is performed using FIFOs which can improve throughput. After initialization, a 16 bit frame is transmitted at 1 Mbps. Software will poll flags rather than using interrupts and/or DMA. The SBCâ€™s status register is read to variable LPSPI1_16bits_read. For UJA1169 the value normally read will be 0xFDEF.

This project uses LPSP1 with Peripheral Chip Select 3, which connects to transceiver UGA1169 .

## Design

1. Disable watchdog
2. System clocks: Initialize SOSC for 8 MHz, sysclk for 80 MHz, RUN mode for 80 MHz
3. Initialize port pins:
   * Enable clock to PORT B
   * PTB14: Configure as LPSPI1_SCK
   * PTB15: Configure as LPSPI1_SIN
   * PTB16: Configure as LPSPI1_SOUT
   * PTB17: Configure as LPSPI1_PCS3
3. Initialize LPSPI1:
   * Module control:
     * Disable module to allow configuration
   * Configure LPSPI as master
   * Initialize clock desired configurations for a 10 MHz prescaled functional clock (100 usec period):
     * Prescaled functional clock frequency = Functional clock / PRESCALE = 40 MHz / 4 = 10MHz
     * SCK baud rate = (Functional clock / PRESCALE) / (SCKDIV+2) = (40 MHz / 4) / (8 + 2) = 10 MHz / 10 = 1 MHz
     * SCK to PCS delay = 5 prescaled functional clocks = 50 nesc
     * PCS to CSK delay = 10 prescaled functional clocks = 1 usec
     * Delay between transfers = 10 prescaled functional clocks = 1 usec.
   * FIFO Control:
     * RxFIFO: Receive Data Flag (RDF) set when # words in FIFO > 0
     * TxFIFO: Transmit Data Flag (TDF) set when # words in FIFO < = 3
   * Configure Transmit Commands (other configurations could be applied later, for example, for data that uses a different chip select and frame size):
     * Prescale functional clock by 8 (80 MHz / 8 = 10 MHz prescaled functional clock)
     * Frame size = 16 bits
     * PCS3 used for peripheral chip select
     * SCK polarity active low
     * Phase: Data changed on SCK leading edge, captured on SCK trailing edge
     * MSB first, byte swap disabled, continuous transfer disabled
     * Single bit width for transfer
     * Normal FIFO use: Rx data stored in Rx FIFO, Tx data loaded from Tx FIFO
   * Module Control:
     * Enable module, including in debug and doze modes
5. Initialize port pins for LPSPI1
5. Loop:
   * Wait for Transmit Data Flag (TDF) to be set (indicates Transmit FIFO availability), then write one SPI frame to Transmit FIFO and clear flag
   * Wait for Receive Data Flag (RDF) to set (indicates Receive FIFO has data to read), then read received SPI frame and clear flag. Expected data: 0xFDEF from UJA1169TK/F
   * Increase counter
